# APT pins are applied before installing packaged or attempting distribution
# upgrades.
#
# Pin Priorities:
#       1000+: Causes a version to be installed even if this constitutes a
#              downgrade of the package.
#    990-1000: Causes a version to be installed even if it does not come from
#              the target release, unless the installed version is more recent.
#     500-990: Causes a version to be installed unless there is a version
#              available belonging to the target release or the installed
#              version is more recent
#     100-500: Causes a version to be installed unless there is a version
#              available belonging to some other distribution or the installed
#              version is more recent
#       0-100: Causes a version to be installed only if there is no installed
#              version of the package
#          <0: Prevents the version from being installed.
#           0: Has undefined behavior, do not use it.
